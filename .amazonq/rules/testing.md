# Testing Rules

## Testing approach
- All features should have tests
- Prefer a test driven approach where we create the test first, review, then create the implementation

## Test Structure
- Never use nested describe blocks in tests
- Use flat describe blocks with descriptive names
- Each test file should have only one top-level describe block per logical grouping
